10/4 Project Meeting
Today we decided on the project management software we wanted to use. After looking at various programs, we decided on Asana. This seemed to offer us the maximum amount of features needed, while keeping the price as low as possible. We then looked around on Asana and explored all available features. We created a table, with columns 'backlog', 'in progress', 'completed'. Each created task also allows us to attach a description and the group member(s) in charge of it. We are also able to color-code tasks to state the urgency. Things seem to be looking good!
