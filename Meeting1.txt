09/25/18 Meeting

Plan: Website or app to read in stories and/or tweets and people can vote on the most relevant/interesting ones and there will be a chronoligical tab and a rankings tabs.

Chronoligical will allow posts to be voted on and rankings tab will show best posts

We can fill empty databases and then have people vote on whatever is in the databases
