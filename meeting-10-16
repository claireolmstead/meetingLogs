1.  We updated eachother on the work that we have completed since last week.
2.  We went over the tables and the columns within these tables that we want to use in our backend.
    There was a lot of debate on what information we want and need to be included in these columns and how this information will affect how we interact with our website.
3.  Next, we discussed the basic outline of what we want our website to look like and its basic elements.
    We were looking at different websites finding inspiration for our CSS and website lay out/general vibe.
