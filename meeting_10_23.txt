Discussion topics:
How interviews have been going so far and what to expect.
The things that we learned we need to do based on our interviews.
We talked a lot about pagination and its functionality and the logistics of how we would implement it into our website.
The security of our website and how to implement that security.
Checking in on how we are feeling about the workload.

What they have done since the last meeting:
We got Django set up and working to the point that the website is running locally through Django rather than just the .html file.
Database made on Heroku with the tables that we discussed the last meeting.
Research what needs to happen in each of our environments to be on the same page and be viewing the same thing and running the same version.
The restful for the news API is functioning.
Prototyping databases in Postgres.

What each person is going to work on before next time:
Start to make sample data and try to get the front end connected to more.
Format the webpage based on the newly introduced data.
Start to connect the webpage with the database.
Stylize the webpage: implement more design elements.

Obstacles:
Dealing with a busy schedule and fitting this into it on top of the lab work and all of our midterms and other class loads.
Learning how to do everything and dealing with errors that we are running into in our code.
